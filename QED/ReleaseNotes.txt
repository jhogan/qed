QED Release Notes

VER 1.4.1
	Fixed bug in release email code. Debug flag was set which prevented emails from being sent.
	
VER 1.4.0
	Forced user to send "Common code was rolled" email after they set rollout to "Rolled"
	Added ticket description to RolloutTicketBreakdown
	Created mnuItemsTruncatedRolloutTicketBreakdown
	General roller clear fields after roll
	
VER 1.3.0
	* Added	"Rollout Ticket Brackdown" report

VER 1.2.0
	* Added Branch/File field and Environment  field
	
	* Added "Rollouts and Branches" report and "Developer Rollout" report.
	
	* Allowed an effort to be assigned to a rollout as long as it hasn't been rolled and is approved (i.e. Effort's client and rollout client don't have to match).

VER 1.1.0
	* Changed the directory copy routine that is mostly used in code promotions so that it will "copy over" a directory rather than deleting 
	the destination directory first and then copying the source dirctory to the destination directory's location. This make it possable to preserve 
	files and subdirectories in the destination directory that may be missing from the source directory. This is closer to the algorithm that normal
	OS directory copies use.

	* Added General Roller

	* Added Rollout completion walkthrough to get efforts closed and send out release emails.
